# E-commerce Project  

## üìñ Overview  
This project is an **E-commerce platform** designed with a **microservices architecture**. It leverages a range of modern technologies to ensure scalability, reliability, and performance. The project demonstrates a modular approach to building large-scale applications while integrating essential services such as authentication, messaging, monitoring, and service discovery. 

This project is inspired by a course created by **Bouali Ali**. You can find more information and resources about the course on his YouTube channel [Bouali Ali](https://www.youtube.com/@BoualiAli), where he dives deep into the development and architecture of such systems.

## üèóÔ∏è Microservices  

### Core Services  
- **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management for all microservices.  
- **Customer Service**: Manages customer profiles, order history, and customer-related operations.  
- **Discovery Service**: Provides service discovery using Eureka to allow microservices to find and communicate with each other dynamically.  
- **Gateway Service**: A single entry point for client requests, routing them to the appropriate services.  
- **Notification Service**: Handles sending notifications to customers about orders, promotions, and updates.  
- **Order Service**: Manages customer orders, including creation, updates, and status tracking.  
- **Payment Service**: Responsible for processing payments, integrating with external payment gateways.  
- **Product Service**: Manages the product catalog, including product listings, details, and inventory.
